# Tex2Pyomo

[tex2pyomo](https://gitlab.tech.orange/yvan.phelizot/tex2pyomo/) is a tool
which transforms MIP written as TeX equations into a Pyomo program.

The original goal is to ensure that what is expressed as a math MIP is
equivalent to the Pyomo program. A mathematician can review equations
and be sure that the results returned by the solver are correct.

A first attempt has been made to transform a Pyomo program into its
equivalent MIP written in TeX. However, Pyomo doesn't keep tracks of a lot
of useful information like variables names, sets...

## How it works

Once the library is installed, you can transform your TeX file.
From [main.py](main.py):

```python
from tex2pyomo.format import format_model
from tex2pyomo.parse import read_model

with open('MIS-model.tex') as f:
   tex = f.read()
   print(format_model(read_model(tex, lambda parser: parser.model())))
```

The function `read_model` uses a parser generated by [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
It reads the tex content, transforms it into an AST and is analyzed into a set of
internal structures.

The function `format_model` uses the internal structures which represents and produces
the Pyomo program.

Those structures only contain the useful information needed to create the program without 
a strong coupling to the parser. The separation makes it easier to change the parser or
extend the program if we need to produce a program for a specific solver, for example.


## Development

### Build the parser

#### Install ANTLR

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
apt-get install antlr4
```

For other platforms, please refer to [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) website.

#### Generate the parser

After cloning the project or each time the [LaTeX grammar](LaTeX.g4) is modified, 
a new python parser has to be generated :

```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 LaTeX.g4 -visitor -o src/latex
```

### Install dependencies

You need to have Python 3.8+ installed.

Here is an example on how to install dependencies with a venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test

You need to install dependencies only once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

### Debug

#### Visualize AST

A java program is available to visualize the AST produced by ANTLR.
Read the [README of treeviewer](treeviewer/README.md).

### Package

The library uses the file [pyproject.toml](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/pyproject_config.html) for the packaging.

```bash
python3 -m build --wheel
```

### OSS Headers

You can use [License Maven Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/) to update legal headers:

```bash
mvn license:update-file-header
```
